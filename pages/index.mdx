# Hello there!

Hey, I'm Ridho. I'm a Software Engineer who loves design. I'm currently building Design System at Ruangguru and Crafting Amazing things at Ruangkerja, an LMS for a training company or organization.

I start my career as a Designer right after graduating from Senior high school. After 1 year, I decided to join the coding boot camp. After that, I entered the world of IT as a software engineer. I have worked with many startups. On top of that, I am so glad I have had opportunities to lead and grow the team starting from the early stage of my career.

I am a highly motivated and enthusiastic person who enjoys taking on challenges and achieving personal goals. I am adaptable, responsible, hardworking, and detail-oriented. I enjoy working on my own initiative or in a team.
